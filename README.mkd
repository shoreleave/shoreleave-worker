shoreleave
==========

A smarter client-side in ClojureScript

###Shoreleave is a collection of integrated libraries that focuses on:

 * Security
 * Idiomatic interfaces
 * Common client-side strategies
 * HTML5 capabilities
 * ClojureScript's advantages

It builds upon efforts found in other ClojureScript projects, such as [Fetch](https://github.com/ibdknox/fetch) and [ClojureScript:One](http://clojurescriptone.com/).


Shoreleave-worker Overview
------------------------
The `worker` namespace provides utilties for embedded web workers, opening up the full potential for current programming in the browser.

This namespace is under *active development* and it is suggested you use this at your own risk.


Plays well with others
----------------------
Shoreleave makes no assumptions about other libraries you might be using in your app.

I have found it to pair particularly well with [Enfocus](https://github.com/ckirkendall/enfocus)


Examples and usage
------------------
Please the github wiki for examples of each library feature
